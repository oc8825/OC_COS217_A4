Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment was definitely difficult, but it forced me to really
dig into using GDB which I have generally tried to avoid. It was
extremely necesary to have a partner in this assignment, as doing
so without one would have been very difficuly and time-consuming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Not fun but definitely helpful

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

To our knowledge, there are no bugs in the submission. We pass all 
tests in the client file and memory tests in valgrind, and all critTer
and splint warnings we are either told to ignore or disagree with 
below. We believe we have earned full credit on this assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

ft.c: line 343: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
ft.c: line 446: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
nodeFT.c: line 78: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'oNContents' through an assert?
nodeFT.c: line 354: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'newContents' through an assert?
      
We disagree with these warnings as it is perfectly valid for a node 
to have null contents (ex: node is a directory or file has no
contents).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2       BDT_freeSubtree() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3       BDT_addChild()  
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4       BDT_strlenAccumulate() 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5       BDT_findNode() 
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

There are several issues present throughout dtGood.c and NodeDtGood.c,
which don’t cause the system of files to fail during testing, but are
simply bad practice. Here is a list of them and how to potentially fix
them: 

Inconsistent Naming Schemes
-DT_Insert and DT_Destroy both have fully spelled out names, but DT_rm
is abbreviated for some reason, it should just be DT_Remove. This is
inconsistent with the rest of the program 
-In Node_hasChild, the order of the parameters is inconsistent with
Node_new. Node_new has oPPath coming before oNParent, while in
Node_hasChild is the other way around. The file should have a
consistent order for parameters that extends to every single
parameter. 
-The method name of Node_hasChild is also a little misleading. It
returns a boolean, but also writes the child's index to an out
parameter. We could perhaps split this function into two with
consistent naming schemes, one for Node_hasChild purely returning a
boolean, and another Node_childIndex returning the index. 

Modularity: 
-Node_addChild is only used once in NodeDTgood.c, where it is used
only in Node_new. We could refactor the logic to be inline with
Node_new, and eliminate unnecessary function overhead by eliminating a
function used truly only once. 
-Dt.c is responsible for destroying and creating nodes, but NodeDTGood
also has logic create and free nodes, this could be a little confusing
and could be modularized. 
-In DT_traversePath and DT_findNode, there is similar logic when
checking for children that could possibly be put into smaller helper
functions to increase readability. 

Naming Conventions: 
-Node_new and Node_free should be renamed to be consistent, like
Node_create and Node_destroy, or like Node_new and Node_delete. 
-Node_compare and Node_compareString, it is immediately obvious what
each function does. We don’t know one compares nodes and one a node to
a string, so it could be renamed to Node_compareNodes and Node
compareNodeToString.
